Final Project Title: Customer Segmentation and Customer Behavior Purchase Prediction At Olist Marketplace

<h1>Problems:</h1>
1. Customer's data regarding gender, location, etc might not be correct 100%, therefore, segmenting customers based on persona is not really accurate<br> 
2. Olist has abundant customers who don't do repurchase in 2018<br> 
3. To maintain sustainable growth of company, it's better to retain the existing customer than to get a new customer<br> 
4. It's harder to maintain customers than to get the new customers<br> 

<h1>Goals:</h2>
1. Retarget/segmenting customers based on the customer's behavior using RFM method (Recency, Monetary and Frequency)<br> 
2. Making Retain Model by analyzing the customer behavior in one year and make a prediction of customer next purchase in the next 1 year. Classify the customers is conducted by dividing customer into chustomers who will do the next purchase < 4 months, > 4 month and > 8 months<br> 
3. Conducting Retention Rate and Churn Rate Analysis to be used as a metrics by Marketing Team<br>
